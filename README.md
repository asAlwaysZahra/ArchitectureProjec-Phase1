# ArchitectureProject-Pahse1
Arcitecture project - phase 1

To run project with test examples, please first compile c code(assemble.c).

After compiling and creating the assemble.exe file, just run it with 2 argument;

the first is input file; which for my test files is i.e. 'tests/test0.as'. 

the second argument is the output file. This file's name should be like 'program.mc'.

The result will be stored in 'progrsm.mc' file next to the c file.
